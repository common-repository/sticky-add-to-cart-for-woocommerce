The WooCommerce Sticky Add to Cart plugin displays a mini content bar at the top of the browser window.

== Description ==

Products these days are more diverse than ever before. The trend is to combine everything in one place, on one page for easy availability.

Some products have long descriptions, reviews, galleries, etc. When you finish reading such information, you often find the add to cart button hidden at the top of the page. The problem becomes equally irritating when you have committed to a product and want to purchase it. Not anymore!

The WooCommerce Sticky Add to Cart plugin displays a mini content bar at the top of the browser window which includes the product name, price, rating, stock status, and everything that holds significance.

The content bar swiftly and subtly slides down into normal view from above once the standard add to cart button has scrolled out of view. Now your customers donâ€™t have to bear the headache of hunting for the cart anymore to add the products they choose!
